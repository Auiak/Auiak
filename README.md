Auiak, signing on

  Dear reader, if you are reading this, good luck on your tasks as an apprentice. May you shed the blood of your enemies with honor and grace.
Astyria has been... different, as of late. I have been preparing for some with Rayvzat, Irene, and Flaria to welcome new trainees, such as you.
There will be lots of trouble ahead. Beware. 

Auiak, signing off.
